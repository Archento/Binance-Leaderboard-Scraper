# Binance-Leaderboard-Scraper
This is the basic shell/template of one of my trading bots which checks your predefined traders for open positions and acts accordingly.

### How To
1. modify ```traders.json``` to include the traders you want to follow.
2. run ```npm install``` once and ```node main.js``` to start the application to see it in action.

Obviously you should modify the application logic to reflect what you want your bot to do with the information...
